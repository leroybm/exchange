# Exchange

A simple cotation viewer

## Features

* Login and user registration via local storage (Yes, I know it's really insecure and a bad practice)
* Session timeout
* Fetch to a api with cotation on the main currencies and cryptocurrencies
* Nice colours
* Data collection from the API whilst the application is running
* A simples graph for the cotations since the application has started

## Nice to haves

* Error messages
* Use of routes (Ops...)
